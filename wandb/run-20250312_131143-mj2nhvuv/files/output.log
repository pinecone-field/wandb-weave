AI’s Emergence and Homogenization
In that talk, Liang coined two terms to describe foundation models:
Emergence refers to AI features still being discovered, such as the many nascent skills in foundation models.  He calls the blending of AI algorithms and model architectures homogenization, a trend that helped form foundation models.  (See chart below. )
The field continues to move fast.
A year after the group defined foundation models, other tech watchers coined a related term — generative AI....
Result 2:
Foundation Models Defined
A foundation model is an AI neural network — trained on mountains of raw data, generally with unsupervised learning — that can be adapted to accomplish a broad range of tasks.
Two important concepts help define this umbrella category: Data gathering is easier, and opportunities are as wide as the horizon.
No Labels, Lots of Opportunity
Foundation models generally learn from unlabeled datasets, saving the time and expense of manually describing each item in massive col...

Of the respondents investing in AI for 5G monetization and/or 6G research and development, 66% are aiming to deploy AI services on RAN for operational and user needs, 53% are aiming to enhance spectral efficiency for the RAN, and 50% are aiming to colocate AI and RAN applications on the same infrastructure.
Generative AI Goes Mainstream
Generative AI is gaining significant attention in telecoms.  More than half of survey respondents who said they’re using generative AI have already deployed the...
