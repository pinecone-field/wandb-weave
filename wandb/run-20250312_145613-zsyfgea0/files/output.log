INFO:__main__:Vector evaluation result: {"relevance": 0.9, "diversity": 0.75, "coverage": 0.85, "explanations": {"relevance": "Most results are highly relevant, explicitly discussing CUDA's role in cybersecurity through aspects like real-time threat detection, acceleration of cryptographic algorithms, and AI model training for security tasks. Results mention NVIDIA technologies, GPUs, and CUDA, directly connecting to the query. A small deduction in score accounts for some results providing general cybersecurity insights without detailed CUDA-specific information.", "diversity": "The results display a reasonable level of diversity, touching on various applications like threat detection, compliance, scalability, integration with other platforms, and the future-proofing against quantum threats. Still, the focus is mainly on NVIDIA's ecosystem, and multiple results converge on similar themes such as threat detection and AI, reducing absolute diversity.", "coverage": "The results cover a wide range of topics within the scope of CUDA and cybersecurity, including threat detection, infrastructure scalability, post-quantum cryptography, and the use of AI and ML in security. However, there's a slight lack of discussion on the technical workings of CUDA or comparisons with other technologies, which could have provided a more comprehensive coverage of how CUDA helps in cybersecurity."}}
