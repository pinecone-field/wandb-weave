Instead of traditional AI models that rapidly generate a one-shot answer to a user prompt, models using this technique allocate extra computational effort during inference, allowing them to reason through multiple potential responses before arriving at the best answer.
On tasks like generating complex, customized code for developers, this AI reasoning process can take multiple minutes, or even hours — and can easily require over 100x compute for challenging queries compared to a single inferenc...
