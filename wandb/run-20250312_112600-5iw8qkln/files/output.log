Gutenburg was especially drawn to NVIDIA’s open culture.  He appreciated how, instead of dwelling on reasons why an idea can’t be pursued, employees are encouraged to discover ways to make it a reality.
“Executing on ideas that improve thermal performance cannot be done alone and is made possible by the work done by all the other engineering disciplines,” he said.  “It can take years of work to fully realize these ideas, but the results can be incredible. ”
