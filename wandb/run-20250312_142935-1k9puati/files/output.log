INFO:__main__:Vector evaluation result: {"relevance": 0.65, "diversity": 0.75, "coverage": 0.8, "explanations": {"relevance": "The search results show a moderate level of relevance to the query about NVIDIA's strategic focus. Result 3 is highly relevant, discussing NVIDIA's focus on AI in telecommunications, while Result 7 is also relevant, detailing NVIDIA's strategy for autonomous vehicles. Result 5 mentions energy efficiency in GPUs, which is somewhat relevant as it speaks to innovation and efficiency, key components of NVIDIA's strategy. Results 1, 4, 6, and 9, although related to NVIDIA's activities and product use cases, do not directly address the strategic focus. Result 2 provides context for the importance of AI, which is relevant but not specific to NVIDIA. Results 8 and 10 are the least relevant as they do not focus on NVIDIA's strategic direction.", "diversity": "The results provide a good variety of aspects of NVIDIA's operations, such as AI in telecommunications, thermal engineering, cybersecurity infrastructure, and the impact on industries like automotive and government. The results do not seem to repeat the same aspect and touch on different applications of NVIDIA's technology.", "coverage": "The results collectively cover several areas of NVIDIA's strategic focuses like AI and computing efficiency in various sectors, including but not limited to telecommunications, autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, government use, and energy efficiency. However, there is limited information on other potential strategic areas such as gaming, professional visualization, and more specific long-term company goals and plans, which are essential parts of NVIDIA's overall strategy."}}
