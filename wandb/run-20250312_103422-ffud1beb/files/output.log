None of the results directly address or answer a specific query, so the relevance across all is low.", "diversity": "The results are topically diverse as they cover different subjects: AI podcasts and platforms, AI's role in enhancing retail customer journeys, and the application of a scientific model named Evo 2. There's little redundancy between them.", "coverage": "Given the lack of specificity in the example query, it is impossible to assess coverage properly. However, presuming the query intended to find information on a general topic such as 'AI', the coverage still would not reflect multiple perspectives or aspects, resulting in a low score."}}

Instead of traditional AI models that rapidly generate a one-shot answer to a user prompt, models using this technique allocate extra computational effort during inference, allowing them to reason through multiple potential responses before arriving at the best answer.
On tasks like generating complex, customized code for developers, this AI reasoning process can take multiple minutes, or even hours — and can easily require over 100x compute for challenging queries compared to a single inferenc...
