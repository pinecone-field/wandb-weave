Setting Up Students and Professionals for Success
The Utah AI education initiative will benefit students entering the job market and working professionals by helping them expand their skill sets beyond community college or adult education courses.
Utah state agencies are exploring how internship and apprenticeship programs can offer students hands-on experience with AI skills, helping bridge the gap between education and industry needs.  This initiative aligns with Utah’s broader goals of foste...

Foundation Models Defined
A foundation model is an AI neural network — trained on mountains of raw data, generally with unsupervised learning — that can be adapted to accomplish a broad range of tasks.
Two important concepts help define this umbrella category: Data gathering is easier, and opportunities are as wide as the horizon.
No Labels, Lots of Opportunity
Foundation models generally learn from unlabeled datasets, saving the time and expense of manually describing each item in massive col...

All results seem to relate to AI and education initiatives, but none provides information on 'NIMs', possibly referring to National Incident Management System, Neural Implicit Models, or other definitions.", "diversity": "Each of the results focuses on a different aspect related to AI, such as podcasts, education initiatives, and foundational AI models, hence the results are diverse and non-redundant.", "coverage": "Given that the results do not address the query about 'NIMs', they fail to cover different aspects of the query. They all appear to be AI-related, which is unrelated to the query, indicating no coverage of the intended topic."}}
