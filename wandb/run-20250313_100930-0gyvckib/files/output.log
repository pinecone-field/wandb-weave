Most of the results focus on various aspects of company culture, employee experiences, and general technology areas without pinpointing a specific standout project.

However, the overlap in themes such as innovation culture and AI technology reduces the diversity score slightly.", "coverage": "The results cover a range of topics related to NVIDIA including culture, engineering approaches, various technology applications, and industry-specific solutions. The coverage is reasonable but not comprehensive in terms of highlighting specific 'interesting projects' that NVIDIA is focused on currently."}}
