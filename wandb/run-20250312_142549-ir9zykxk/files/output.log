INFO:__main__:Vector evaluation result: {"relevance": 0.8, "diversity": 0.7, "coverage": 0.85, "explanations": {"relevance": "Most of the search results provide discussions or information related to the concept of sovereign AI and its applications in various sectors such as telecommunications, government, and educational initiatives. Result 1 and Result 2, however, seem unrelated as they just offer links to a podcast without context. Result 6 also seems partially irrelevant as it broadly discusses AI agents in retail without direct connection to sovereign AI.", "diversity": "The results show variety in the context of sovereign AI, like telecom deployments (Result 3), language and culture-oriented models (Result 4, Result 5), policy and workforce transformation discussions (Result 7), and data center and educational initiatives (Result 9). Despite this, Results 1 and 2 are identical, effectively lowering diversity, and several results cover similar ground regarding partnerships and infrastructure.", "coverage": "Different aspects of sovereign AI are covered, such as its strategic role in local initiatives, government approaches, and educational impacts on AI. The results, though varied, tend to concentrate on applications and discussions around sovereign AI rather than providing a clear and concise definition or theoretical perspective, which means the coverage, while good, is not exhaustive of the query."}}
